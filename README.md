# Infographic design for a Horned Grebe study


## About
This is an infographic design contract from Kirsty Gurney (ECCC) for a presentation in the upcoming “Science to Policy” day meeting. 

- [Outline](./docs/outline.md)


## Request from client

We will include the infographic as slide in the presentation deck, so it can be projected in the room and displayed online simultaneously. Dimensions fitting the default ‘widescreen’ (16:9) format in PowerPoint are preferred. High-resolution imagery would be ideal, but the slides/infographics themselves will be presented as the standard powerpoint slide sizes.
